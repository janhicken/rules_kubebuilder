## Updating BUILD files

Some targets are generated from sources.
Currently this is just the `bzl_library` targets.
Run `bazel run //:gazelle` to keep them up-to-date.

## Using this as a development dependency of other rules

You'll commonly find that you develop in another WORKSPACE, such as
some other ruleset that depends on rules_kubebuilder, or in a nested
WORKSPACE in the integration_tests folder.

To always tell Bazel to use this directory rather than some release
artifact or a version fetched from the internet, run this from this
directory:

```sh
OVERRIDE="--override_repository=rules_kubebuilder=$(pwd)/rules_kubebuilder"
echo "common $OVERRIDE" >> ~/.bazelrc
```

This means that any usage of `@rules_kubebuilder` on your system will point to this folder.

## Releasing

Releases are automated on a cron trigger.
The new version is determined automatically from the commit history, assuming the commit messages follow conventions, using
https://github.com/marketplace/actions/conventional-commits-versioner-action.
If you do nothing, eventually the newest commits will be released automatically as a patch or minor release.
This automation is defined in .github/workflows/tag.yaml.

Rather than wait for the cron event, you can trigger manually. Navigate to
https://github.com/janhicken/rules_kubebuilder/actions/workflows/tag.yaml
and press the "Run workflow" button.

If you need control over the next release version, for example when making a release candidate for a new major,
then: tag the repo and push the tag, for example

```sh
% git fetch
% git tag v1.0.0-rc0 origin/main
% git push origin v1.0.0-rc0
```

Then watch the automation run on GitHub actions which creates the release.
